I had 2 meetings lined
                up within 90 minutes (one with slang, one usual update meeting as my at the time Job), I thought I’ll talk with slanglabs for about 30 minutes and then rush off to the other location. 90 minutes later I was still sitting with slanglabs,
                I had missed the other meeting. A company that is actually making a useful product and not something that just seems to be working, also a design thinking company. At first, they wanted to get some illustrations made for the website. When
                they first explained to me what they were doing, I was not aware of their achievements. I heard their product idea the same way as I used to listen from a college friend when they wanted to jump on the “startup bandwagon”. Except here,
                as I listened to it the thing that came to my mind was this can actually be big, and a thing that we use every day.“to me better voice based experiences are imminent. <strong>It sounded to me like an idea, you don’t think about whether it will work or not, but someone be able to pull this off.”</strong><br>to
                me better voice-based experiences are imminent. It sounded to me like an idea, you don’t think about whether it will work or not, but someone be able to pull this off. And by the time they contacted me they had already made it work. So
                from the first day, the pressure was on.&nbsp;I had planned that I will be finishing this job in 20–30 days and while doing this, I will also be working part-time at another place. But now because of this talk, I knew that I will have
                to give all my time to this. The pressure was on. (although they never put it on me)I felt I was underprepared for the work. I felt like I should read everything written about making illustrations for tech companies, I think I read most
                of what I could find on the internet and here on medium, of course, Meg Robichaud is one of the medium writers that stood out, read on how other companies have used illustrations, how their process was like.&nbsp;<br>Slack, Airbnb, Shopify,
                medium, how they have used illustrations, in hopes that I will get some “Must avoid lists” or something. I did not get any list rather, that led me to read more, that made me curious to understand why people used illustrations in the first
                place. But anyways I made a list of companies that used them and wrote down what is the purpose they are serving. Honestly, I was just clueless at this point, had no idea whether this list will help me or not, but nothing else seems to&nbsp;I
                didn’t find any “must avoid” but one thing I learned from making that list is that the reason people were making a similar looking illustration for the for tech products was not just because they were lazy, but because they wanted everything
                to match with the already established UI of the product. Since the modern UIs have gradients and curved Buttons, no borders on everything(in contrast to the Windows 98).<br>As pointed out in these two articles below, The reason for such
                illustrations may also have been just the use of modern software.<a href="https://www.subtraction.com/2018/01/03/two-different-kinds-of-illustration/"><strong>Two Very Different Kinds of Illustration</strong></a><br><a href="https://www.subtraction.com/2018/01/03/two-different-kinds-of-illustration/"><em>In late December The New York Times published “ The Year in Illustration,” a round-up of the dozens of commissioned…</em>www.subtraction.com</a>

                    href="https://medium.com/@borism/on-the-visual-weariness-of-the-web-8af1c969ce73"><strong>Why Do All Websites Look the Same?</strong></a><br><a href="https://medium.com/@borism/on-the-visual-weariness-of-the-web-8af1c969ce73"><em>The internet suffers from a lack of imagination, so I asked my students to redesign it</em>medium.com</a>The
                    reason that is highlighted in both of these things is that probably the first people who made the illustrations are UX/UI designers only and they made illustrations with the tools that they use for all the other UI design work, things
                    like Sketch or Invision, whereas an can start from paper and ink to Rorschach inkblots to collage to photoshop drawings to adobe illustrator. if you want to learn by looking at some work like this inboard with apple store illustrations
                    is a good source, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/khoi/app-store-editorial-illustrations/">https://www.pinterest.com/khoi/app-store-editorial-illustrations/</a> one of the problems with these illustrations is that not all of them
                    can be used for tech, still have a look, if you are following this you’ll be able to pick out the suitable ones.Ok, so how do we solve this problem, the problem being, “using monoculture illustrations is cliche is very common, but
                    using anything else is like going incoherent with the other ui elements, broadly speaking, buttons and the way things are layed out”?So, one solution that i came up with was tweaking the UI according to the style we pick. I’ll continue
                    what happened to solve this problem after we pick the illustration style first.<strong>this is all research for the work, or <em>“meta-level thoughts</em>”(as Kumar would put it) that were going through my head(and what created these questions), but I also want to tell what was I doing on paper that time.</strong>Ok
                    so even though there was all this confusion that I mentioned above, I had a submission date and a lot of work to do before I could buy more time to work on this.<br>I was given a color palette, and general guidelines about the illustrations:
                    Scalable, Goes with the way we think of ourselves, urban, yet neat, perfectionists, anti-establishment. One more developed direction was that maybe I can explore the graffiti style<br>So we are going back to day 0 again, After looking
                    at all the illustration process from other people, I spent about 6 dense days of working continuously, thinking all the time about solving this problem, coming up with ideas. No facebook, no emails no socializing, no dressing up nicely,
                    just work. During these days I kept looking at other people’s styles for hours, tried to explore my own style, practiced exaggerated figure drawing in the metro, even went to a Starbucks just so that I can paint people on a big canvas.
                    (because apparently, you can do whatever you want in Starbucks, they won’t ask you to leave)these 2 people probably discussing work at the Starbucks. a usual scene in Bangalore though.So, I tried to take inspiration from this posture
                    and make something that is more usable.<br><br><br><br>2ndly making something that looks like graffiti,<br>and finally, a version that I thought that fits the other things going in my mind, (Which I described above)<br>and these also.<br>these
                    are primarily the 3 images that I came up&nbsp;withtI presented them with these and asked them to choose one style, I was happy that they liked it(at least in those days they did). on the first meet they were leaning towards the bauhaus/Memphis
                    style.In reply I was asked to make another set of illustrations for each style. so i did and we went with the the earlier choice only.As i said mentioned earlier, that this style of illustration will work the best with a tweaked UI
                    so, that’s what we did, made the buttons like below and put the structure of the website in a grid system, thus making everything more consistent.as you can see these elements of the UI have been stylized accordingly&nbsp;since i am
                    documenting a long time after this was done, in the meantime i saw something like that on Stanford's design website as well <a href="https://dschool.stanford.edu/">https://dschool.stanford.edu/</a>.<br><br><br><br><br>Finally writing
                    down what this style was(can be completely different for you if you are making one):so whatever happened above was a result of a intuition heavy sprint, now slowing down and writing the principles to continue making similar style works.here
                    were some of the rules I noted down from the style.<br>&nbsp;Some rules for me:having a boundary over every shape in the illustration.2d vision angleUse only as much detail as required to portray the idea. It’s okay to use a lot of
                    detail if it is the only way to convey.all shadows blackHands because they can communicate things like expressions without being very on your face, although they need to be precise to do that.<br>&nbsp;following the rules of that universe&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;bold
                    because of outlines<br>&nbsp;Avoid human figures, but if they are used, they should be more like silhouettes. Why? Because they should not cover a lot other than that they are human figures.the idea in both of these was that 2 people
                    who represent voice and touch are doing a different type of works, moving towards the same goal. Which is what VAX is in a way.the idea in both of these was that 2 people who represent voice and touch are doing a different type of
                    works, moving towards the same goal. Which is what VAX is in a&nbsp;way.To conclude i will say that even though it is hard to make a lot of diversity in the illustration style in the tech, partly because of the webpage size, you need
                    to know the line, Any illustration style can be a good illustration style as long as UI can be adjusted to it and if it is appropriate for the content/message of the website/company.</p>
